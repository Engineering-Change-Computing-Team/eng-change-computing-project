## Who we are

We are a team of six undergraduate students from Imperial College London who are passionate about using our Engineering skills to combat climate change. </br>

The team is sharing back-end and front-end tasks to ensure everyone gets to learn both sides of development. </br>

The team met through Imperial's Engineering Change society. More information about the society and their other projects can be found on the [union website](https://www.imperialcollegeunion.org/activities/a-to-z/engineering-change) or [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/EngChangeIC/). </br> 

The project is led and supervised by Dr Pedro Baiz.

## The project

The project brief is to develop a mobile application that can measure the carbon content in a plot of land using satellite data. </br>


We will be using **Figma** for UI/ UX development. The app will be built using **Flutter**. </br>

The project will implement an AI program written by a Master's student to calculate the carbon content in a plot of land. Once this is complete, a link to the code will be added [here]().

## Goals of summer 2021

Given the short time-frame of the project (summer 2021), we will be developing the Minimum Viable Product. This will be a hybrid app (one for both iOS and Android) that can simply plot the boundary for a plot of land and calculate the carbon content. Future teams from Engineering Change will improve what we have developed by adding more features.
